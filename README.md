# Titanic Survival Prediction - Random Forest Classifier

This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and interpretation using feature importance.

## ðŸ§  Summary

- **Objective:** Predict survival using machine learning models with a focus on Random Forest.
- **Key Features Used:** `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare`, among others.
- **Outcome:** Random Forest outperformed other models due to its ensemble nature, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

## ðŸ“Š Features Explored

The analysis suggests the following factors most strongly affected survival:
- Gender (`Sex`)
- Age
- Fare paid

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
