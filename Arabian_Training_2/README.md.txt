ü´Ä Heart Attack Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a data science notebook that explores and predicts the risk of heart attacks using machine learning algorithms. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

üìÅ Project Structure

- `heart_attack.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all data analysis, visualization, model building, and evaluation.
- Dataset: Loaded within the notebook (assumed to be from a CSV file).
- Models used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier.

üìä Dataset Description

The dataset contains several clinical and demographic variables commonly used in cardiovascular risk prediction, such as:

- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
- `cp`: Chest pain type
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang`: Exercise-induced angina
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise
- `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- `ca`: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- `thal`: Thalassemia type
- `target`: Heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)

## üîç Workflow Summary
